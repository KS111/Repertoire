With a study mode -- where the user can study virtual flash cards to help with memorizing non-phonetic ideograms -- and a game mode -- where the user can work on learning ideograms through a flash card game -- users are empowered to choose how they learn a second, or subsequent, language.

- [ ] As a platform for general subject learning

    - [ ] For the amateur lepidopterist - create a butterfly deck to reinforce your field identification skills
    - [ ] For the computer scientist - create a decimal to hexadecimal base deck to reinforce your skills at different number bases
    - [ ] For the advanced math student - create a derivative rules deck to help memorize how to take those pesky derivatives depending on the expressions being evaluated
